=head1 Error Codes

The following game error codes may be thrown by the Lacuna game server.

=head2 1000 Name not available.

Perhaps it already exists, or it's blank, or it contains unusable characters.

=head2 1001 Invalid password. 

Passwords cannot be empty and they must be at least 6 characters long.

=head2 1002 Object does not exist.

The object you've requested by id doesn't exist.

=head2 1003 Too much information.

You've requested too much information from the server at once.

=head2 1004 Password incorrect.

The user mistyped the password, or doesn't know it.

=head2 1005 Contains invalid characters.

Thrown when a text field contains invalid characters.

=head2 1006 Authorization denied.

A basic authorization denied error, because the session you're trying to connect with doesn't exist or has expired.

=head2 1007 Overspend.

You have tried to spend more resources than you have.

=head2 1008 Underspend.

You need to spend more resources than you have spent.

=head2 1009 Invalid range.

The items in the range don't fit the rules for the range. For example, habitable stellar orbits must be consecutive, so a range of 1,3,5 would trigger this error.
