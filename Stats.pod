=head1 Server Overview

A complete overview of the server statistics is available from B<http://servername.lacunaexpanse.com/server_overview.json>. This file contains many statistics about the server, but not any that you could calculate using the data provided in order to keep the file small. For example, we tell you how many stars have been probed, and how many probes there are, but we don't give you the average number of probes per star, because you could calculate that yourself.
