=head1 Map Data

An export of the public map data (ie the Stars), is available to download in an easy to use CSV format. The URL is

 http://gameservername.lacunaexpanse.com.s3.amazonaws.com/stars.csv

So if the server name is "us-east-1", then the the URL would be

 http://us-east-1.lacunaexpanse.com.s3.amazonaws.com/stars.csv

=head1 Map Methods

These methods are accessible via the C</map> URL.

=head2 get_stars ( session_id, x1, y1, x2, y2 )

Retrieves a chunk of the map and returns it as an array of hashes. B<Note:> Coordinates without a star will not be returned in the results.

 { 
    "stars" : [
        {
            "name"          : "Sol",
            "color"         : "yellow",
            "x"             : -41,
            "y"             : 27,
            "bodies"        : [     # only added if a probe is present
                {
                    same data as get_status() on /body
                },
                ...
            ]
        },
        {
            "name"          : "X143S",
            "color"         : "green",
            "x"             : -42,
            "y"             : 27
        }
     ],
    "status" : { ... }
 }

The data you retrieve will allow you to draw a standard cartesian plane like the following. 

              y
              
              |
              |
     (-3,3)   |  (3,3)
              |
 -x ----------+---------- x
              |
     (-3,-3)  |  (3,-3)
              |
              |
