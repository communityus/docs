 }

=head3 session_id

A session id.


=head2 solve ( session_id, captcha_guid, captcha_solution )

Validates the user's solution against the known solution for the given guid. If the solution validates, the captcha will be valid for thirty minutes (an expiration timestamp is set in the session) and it returns a value of 1.

Throws 1014.

B<NOTE:> If either C<captcha_guid> or C<captcha_solution> don't match what the server is expecting it will throw a 1014 error, and the data portion of the error message will contain new captcha information. You must use this. A captcha cannot be used more than once.

=head3 session_id

A session id.

=head3 captcha_guid

This must match the C<guid> field returned by the C<fetch> method.
